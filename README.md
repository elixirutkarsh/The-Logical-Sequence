# The-Logical-Sequence
Can you find the missing number in the following sequence?

2, 5, 11, 23, __, 95

Solution:
The missing number in the sequence can be determined by observing the pattern:

Each number in the sequence is obtained by doubling the previous number and then adding 1. Therefore, the pattern can be described as follows:

2 * 2 + 1 = 5
5 * 2 + 1 = 11
11 * 2 + 1 = 23
23 * 2 + 1 = 47
47 * 2 + 1 = 95

So, the missing number in the sequence is 47.
